This is the script I use to restart the text to JSON conversion chat

---- First Chat -----

I have some text that I want you to convert to JSON for me

heres the first bit of text

Question 1: What is the chief and highest end of man?
Answer 1: Man’s chief and highest end is to glorify God,[1] and fully to enjoy him forever.[2]

1. Rom. 11:36; I Cor. 10:31
2. Psa. 73:24-28

and heres the JSON format I want it in

 {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the chief and highest end of man?",
    answer: [
      "Man’s chief and highest end is to glorify God,",
      "and fully to enjoy him forever.",
    ],
    proofTexts: [
      [
        {
          book: "Rom.",
          verse: "11:36",
          text: "",
        },
        {
          book: "I Cor.",
          verse: "10:31",
          text: "",
        },
      ],
      [
        {
          book: "Psa.",
          verse: "73:24-28",
          text: "",
        },
      ],
    ],
  }

heres another bit of text

Q2: How doth it appear that there is a God?
A2: The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God;[1] but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.[2]

1. Rom. 1:19-20; Psa. 19:1-3; Acts 17:28
2. I Cor. 2:9-10; II Tim. 3:15-17; Isa 59:21

and I want that to be converted into the same format of JSON as above

 {
    id: 2,
    question: "How doth it appear that there is a God?",
    answer: [
      "The very light of nature in man, and the works of God, declare plainly that there is a God;",
      "but his word and Spirit only do sufficiently and effectually reveal him unto men for their salvation.",
    ],
    proofTexts: [
      [
        {
          book: "Rom.",
          verse: "1:19-20",
          text: "",
        },
        {
          book: "Psa.",
          verse: "19:1-3",
          text: "",
        },
        {
          book: "Acts",
          verse: "17:28",
          text: "",
        },
      ],
      [
        {
          book: "I Cor.",
          verse: "2:9-10",
          text: "",
        },
        {
          book: "II Tim.",
          verse: "3:15-17",
          text: "",
        },
        {
          book: "Isa",
          verse: "59:21",
          text: "",
        },
      ],
    ],
  },

If I keep pasting in similar bits of text can you convert them into that format of JSON?

Looks good. But do you notice how in the book field it is an abbreviation of bible books? Can you replace the abbreviation with the full bible book name
